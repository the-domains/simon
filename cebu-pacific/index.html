<p>Simon N. Ostheimer cuts through Bangkok traffic to uncover its
food truck scene</p><p>I'm standing in the middle of a field, surrounded by trucks, and
I'm not sure which way to turn. Let's backtrack a little bit. It's a
Friday night, and I'm in Bangkok, a stone's throw from Punnawithi BTS
station, at a rather cool event called the M.A.P. Weekend Fest. It's
one of those effortlessly hip outdoor markets Thais are so good at
putting together, with stalls selling everything from vintage jeans
to handmade dresses from Nepal, handicrafts and jewellery, a stage
featuring the gentle strumming of indie-folk bands, an entire section
devoted to dog accessories (seriously), and an unbelievable amount of
amazing food.</p><p>Back in the field, I'm at a complete loss what to choose: there's
the double cheese wagyu burger at Burgler Burger, with its oddly
worded slogan: “Feel good to be bad”; right next to the
Danish-style hot dogs at Food Stop (yeah, we were curious too: it's
crispy sausage with 'special' Danish sauce, fried onion and pickle).
Then, just a few feet away, there's Monkey Brownies, run out of a
vintage blue and white VW van, which has drawn me over with its
Gorillaz-style logo, but kept my attention with an array of homemade
brownies. 
</p><p>On the other side of the huge grass lawn is Answer Cheeze, where
people are lining up to order chunky grilled cheese toasties. There's
also a queue at Ugly Dog, whose icon is a rather crazed looking
canine – compared to that the hot dogs seem to be more traditional
in terms of filling, but come served in exotic-looking buns like the
black 'charcoal', and a homemade organic rice berry. Just when I
think that there can't be any more, I happen across the burgers and
bright yellow van of Street Burger, right next door to the
taxi-styled Hungry Meter, whose specialty is Philly cheesesteaks. By
this point, I'm pretty much sold on their take on the sloppy,
delicious smelling sandwiches, but then I spy one last food truck
over in the corner, and its large hand-drawn sign that reads 'Two
Angels Tacos'. 
</p><p>“Hey man, what's up, I'm Pat”, says the easygoing truck owner
Pattanapong Sukduang. Although obviously of Thai heritage, he is
originally from California. “I had this idea of bringing tacos to
the people ages ago, but it just never seemed the right time,” Pat
tells me, as I tuck into a plate of his 'Roi Choi' tacos, Pat's
homage to the man who founded the modern food truck movement in 2008,
Korean-American chef Roy Choi. “Then the food truck scene in
Bangkok just exploded,” he continues, “and we had to get onboard
quick.” 
</p><p>I ask him how many trucks he reckons there are currently roaming
the streets of the Thai capital. “There are easily more than a
thousand, man, they are just everywhere.” While food trucks often
congregate at markets like the one I'm at, usually they have changing
daily stops where they pull up and park, often on busy nightlife
streets like Thong Lor, or sometimes they partner with bars, like the
famous symbiotic relationship that exists between Craft beer bar on
Sukhumvit 23 and burger van Daniel Thaiger, known for its signature
mac 'n' cheese burger. They also attend the big music festivals that
take place in and around Bangkok, but mostly it's a case of trial by
error – seeing what locations work.</p><p>The next night I find myself in a different part of town,
disembarking the BTS train at Sala Daeng station. I'm hunting down
Bangkok's most unique food truck, indeed, if it can really be called
that. Behind an upscale Thai restaurant, occupying a quiet courtyard,
I find what I'm looking for. Lit up by strings of lights, and
furnished with red check tablecloth covered tables, a small team of
waitstaff hover around well-dressed patrons, while at the center of
it all is a large truck bearing the beaming words: Pizza Massilia.
The entire side wall of the truck is folded open, two huge
chalkboards bearing the menu, while in the middle is the 'kitchen',
which features a full-sized wood-fired oven and pizza making station.
It's a very impressive, almost romantic set-up, though the manager
seems somewhat flustered. I later discover the understandable reason
is that they're in the frantic last stages of opening up a proper
bricks and mortar restaurant. I guess we all have to settle down some
time.</p><p>BOX</p><p>Ten Trucks to Try</p><p>Answer Cheeze</p><p>Sometimes the simplest things in life are best. The two guys that
run bright yellow food truck Answer Cheeze reckon they have things
sorted, with an easy menu of grilled cheese sandwiches. You have a
choice of Hawaiian (ham and pineapple), BBQ pork, or mixed cheese,
all served in thick sliced white bread packed with oozing melted
cheese. With the Bangkok crowds flocking to try their sarnies, the
pair are doing something right – though you'd expect nothing less
from a former international hotel chef and restaurant manager.</p><p>facebook.com/answercheezebkk</p><p>Burgler Burger</p><p>Running Daniel Thaiger close in the burger stakes is this
ambitious newcomer. In case you're wondering, the name isn't a
rip-off of the Hamburglar, but more about the fact that the meats and
buns used have been 'appropriated' from the luxury Sofitel So Bangkok
(the hotel owner is a co-owner of Burgler Burger). This means that,
as well as often being parked outside the Sofitel, for 229 baht you
can have a 150g wagyu burger or, for just a little more, the whopping
180g 'Nuclear' version. Be warned, things might get messy.</p><p>facebook.com/burglerthailand</p><p>Daniel Thaiger</p><p>21,500 fans on Facebook can't be wrong. If anyone kickstarted the
city's food truck craze, it was most likely Mark and Honey Falconi,
the Thai-Western couple behind Daniel Thaiger (it's named after their
son). As the story goes, one day they were complaining with friends
that there were no good burgers in town, and decided to do something
about it. While they still sometimes roam around Bangkok, these days
you'll mostly found them parked on Sukhumvit 23 next to popular bar
Craft. Make sure you get there early to avoid the queue.</p><p>facebook.com/danielthaiger</p><p>Food Stop</p><p>If there's one thing that was missing on the mean streets of
Bangkok, it was Danish-style hot dogs. No? Us neither. Still, full
credit to this food truck for trying to bring something different to
the table. For their signature Danish hotdog, the sausage is covered
with special Danish sauce, fried onions and pickle; while the
Cocktail has cocktail sauce and cabbage. For us, the Zaab (spicy Thai
sauce and mayonnaise) is a step too far, but if you just can't get
enough of their dogs, you'll be interested to know they do sell
franchises.</p><p>facebook.com/foodstopth</p><p>Hungry Meter</p><p>facebook.com/hungrymeter</p><p>Monkey Brownies</p><p>Okay, we'll admit that this isn't a food truck in the traditional
sense, but the VW van does have four wheels and serves sustenance.
With that qualification out of the way, instead concentrate on the
amazing homemade brownies and soft cookies that they sell, including
flavours like walnut, peanut butter, cream cheese, raisin, green tea,
cashew nut and strawberry white chocolate. If, like us, you've just
gorged yourself silly from one of the other food trucks on this list,
then make like a monkey and grab a box to take home.</p><p>facebook.com/monkey_brownies-141809312672455</p><p>Pizza Massilia</p><p>What do you get when you merge a food truck with a pizzeria?
Probably something close to Pizza Massilia. While it is technically a
truck, and thus movable, in reality this is more of an outdoor
restaurant, occupying a quiet courtyard at the back of an upscale
restaurant. The menu is written in chalk on huge black blackboards
(the opened side panels of the truck), while the open kitchen is
dominated by the wood fire pizza oven. Diners sit at red-checked
tablecloth tables, and enjoy amazing pizza accompanied by Italian
draft beer.</p><p>pizzamassilia.com</p><p>Street Burger</p><p>facebook.com/streetburgerbkk</p><p>Two Angels Tacos</p><p>For expat Californian Pat, aka Pattanapong Sukduang, there's no
place like home. So he decided to share his love of Los Angeles
street food with the good people of that other City of Angels,
Bangkok. From a truck tagged in street-style graffiti, he serves some
mean tacos using homemade corn tortillas and a mix of classic
fillings such as carne asada (beef) and Thai-flavoured takes like tom
yum goong. For just 60 baht each, it's obvious this is a labour of
love. You can usually find Pat and his tacos at night on trendy Thong
Lor.</p><p>facebook.com/twoangelstacos</p><p>Ugly Dog</p><p>facebook.com/uglydogstreethotdog</p><p><i data-grid-id="d6a2a8d3-7264-4be6-8011-3001a8637ed3">Follow them on Facebook to find out where they are</i></p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="24"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="25"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="26"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="27"><span data-reactid="28"><!-- react-empty: 29 --><h2 data-reactid="30"><a data-reactid="31">Simon</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="34"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="35"></div></section></div></div>
